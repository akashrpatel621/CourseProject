# Investy
For the CS411 course project, our  team built Investy, An interactive financial advising application for stock trading that generates portfolios based on user preferences and available resources. Investy allows users to get one on one financial advice for trading stocks based on a portfolio. Users have to sign in to the application to generate the portfolio and view their personalized dashboard. The application takes parameters such as initial investment and period of time one expects to hold an investment and uses this information to generate a personalized portfolio detailing suggestions with three risk factors: low, medium, and high volatility. Investy is built to serve those who may not necessarily possess the know-how to properly and successfully navigate the stock market and  also can be a great resource for experienced traders. All data in our  database are real quantitative and qualitative data from live/historical stock data APIs.

We used a NoSQL database in our project to store all relevant stock information that our Machine learning model will use to be trained on in order to predict future stock prices.
